order of execution in java --> general flow when there is a main method ...
=====================================================================================

1. generally static loading or class loading will happen ---> loaded into the stack memory 
2. Block execution is first in java --> means as soon as the memory is allocated the blocks are executed non explicitely means in this case now the class loading is done
so the memory is allocated for static members so static blocks gets executed 
3. main method --> the third thing to happen is to start the execution of the main method --> main method is static becoz it should be available in the memory when the main threads calls it or invokes it 
for execution 
4. then the execution depends on what you did inside the main ....
5. lets say now you have declared the non static member and the memory is allocated in the heap when you use the new operator
6. once the memory is allocated the first thing is to execute the block as stated earlier ---> now the non static execution will happen 
7. after this one the custructor is called
